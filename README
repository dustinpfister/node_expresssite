my first attempt at making a website useing node.js, useing express, passport, mongoDB, bootstrap, ejs, and jQuery just to name a few.

The idea i had in mind for this project was just a simple hello world of sorts when it comes to getting a node.js project off the ground. i wanted just a simple example of a site where i can create and account, login, and maybe view public profiles of other accounts. 

Becuase i do not intend to publish this project, i am not that concerned with security aspects such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), however i did touch base with CSP ( Content-Security-Policy ) allowing for scripts from 'self', and 'unsafe-inline' (for now anyway).

i also do not have any intent for more advanced features (at least not for this project), just a plain basic generic site.

The project went well, i got the basic idea i had in mind togeather in a flash, and i am now ready to start making a more interesting project based on what i learned.

start by cloning it in

$ git clone https://github.com/dustinpfister/node_expresssite


install dependencies:

$ npm install express
$ npm install express-session
$ npm install body-parser
$ npm install cookie-parser
$ npm install morgan

// using passport with local strategy for authentication
$ npm install passport
$ npm install passport-local

// playing with ejs for views
$ npm install ejs
$ npm install express-ejs-layouts

// must have MongoDB installed to get mongoose working

$ sudo apt-get install mogodb-server

// ran into a problem getting mongoose installed on xubuntu 14.04 i386 in vertualBox 5.x, but this helped:
// now using a 64 bit native server, but installed it anyway:

$ sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev

// make sure you have build essential

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential

// get mongoose, hopfully with no errors
$ npm install mongoose

// try running the server
$ node server.js
